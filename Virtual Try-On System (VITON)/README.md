# Virtual Try-On System (VITON)

## Overview

The Virtual Try-On System (VITON) is a Python-based application that allows users to try on clothing items virtually using deep learning techniques. This project leverages a pre-trained segmentation model to overlay clothing items on images of individuals, creating a realistic virtual fitting experience.

## Features

- Upload images of clothing and a model (person) to see how the clothing would look on them.
- Uses a pre-trained segmentation model to segment clothing items.
- Blends the clothing onto the model image, creating a virtual try-on effect.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- PyTorch
- OpenCV
- torchvision

## Usage

1. **Prepare your images:**
   - Place your model image (person) and clothing image (garment) in the project directory.

2. **Edit the paths in the code:**
   - Update the file paths in the script to point to your model and clothing images.

3. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   python viton.py
4.** View the Results**

The application will display the resulting image with the clothing applied to the model.

## Dataset

For this project, you can use any images of clothing and models. Some recommended sources for datasets include:

- [DeepFashion](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/DeepFashion/InshopRetrieval.html)
- [Fashion-MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist)

Ensure that you have the right to use any images you download, especially for commercial purposes.

## Future Enhancements

- Integrate Augmented Reality (AR) features for real-time virtual try-on.
- Implement user feedback mechanisms to improve the virtual try-on experience.
- Expand the clothing catalog and provide recommendations based on user preferences.
